# Taxonomy and Evaluation of XAI Tools for Explainable Machine Learning

Supplementary material of the paper " Taxonomy and Evaluation of XAI Tools for Explainable Machine Learning " submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (2025).

## Abstract

A persistent problem in machine learning (ML) lies in the lack of transparency of the resulting predictive models. The principles of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are especially needed to foster trust in ML applications by opening the “black box" to understand the inner workings of ML systems. XAI methods are effective for inspecting ML models, understand how data affect their predictions, or assessing their fairness. Tools facilitate access to XAI methods, providing graph-
ical environments for generating and analysing different types of explanations. In this work, we present a taxonomy of XAI tools, offering a detailed analysis of the methods they implement and their user-oriented features. Based on three dimensions and 31 characteristics, we compare
15 XAI tools, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The goals of our study are to analyse the current landscape of XAI tools, expand the use of lesser-known XAI techniques and highlight the usefulness of these tools in analysing ML models beyond performance evaluation.
## Additional material

This repository includes the following documents:

- Check-list to assess the quality of the documentation in XAI tools.
- Spreadsheed with the evaluation of XAI tools based on the three dimensions of the proposed taxonomy:
	- Metadata dimension: Classification of the tools according to technical and availability characteristics.
	- Scope and general purpose dimension: Evaluation of the functionalities supported by the tool in terms of data types, ML models and forms of explanation.
	- Explainaibility methods dimension: Detailed categorisation of the explainable methods implemented.
